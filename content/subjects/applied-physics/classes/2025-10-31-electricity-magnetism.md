# Electricity & Magnetism

This is a 4-credit Physics course covering fundamental concepts of electricity and magnetism.

## Chapter 1: Electrostatics

### Main Topics Covered

1. **Electric Charge Basics**

   - Fundamental properties of electric charges
   - Conservation of charge
   - Quantization of charge

2. **Coulomb's Law**

   - Force between two point charges: $F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$
   - Where $k = 8.99 \times 10^9$ N·m²/C²
   - Electrostatic force vs Gravitational force (magnitude difference ~$10^{39}$ times in atoms)

3. **Electric Fields**

   - Definition and properties
   - Field due to point charges
   - Gauss' Law applications

4. **Electric Dipoles**
   - Two opposite charges separated by distance
   - Dipole moment
   - Field and potential due to dipoles

### Worked Problems

#### Example 1: Hydrogen Atom Forces

- Calculating electrostatic force between proton and electron
- Comparing with gravitational force
- Demonstration that electrostatic force >> gravitational force

#### Example 2: Hanging Charged Spheres

- Problem involving charged spheres in equilibrium
- Application of Coulomb's Law and force balance

## Course Topics Overview

### Main Areas:

1. **Electrostatics** - charges, Coulomb's Law, electric fields, Gauss' Law
2. **Electric Potential** - equipotential surfaces, potential energy
3. **Capacitors** - parallel plate, series/parallel, energy storage, dielectrics
4. **DC Circuits** - current, resistance, Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Rules, RC circuits
5. **Magnetism** - magnetic fields, forces, Biot-Savart Law, inductance, Faraday's Law
6. **AC Circuits** - oscillations, RLC circuits, transformers, magnetic properties
