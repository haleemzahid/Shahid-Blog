# Introduction to Waves

Understanding wave motion and properties.

## Wave Types
1. **Transverse**: Oscillation perpendicular to direction (light, string)
2. **Longitudinal**: Oscillation parallel to direction (sound)

## Wave Properties
- Amplitude (A)
- Wavelength (λ)
- Frequency (f)
- Period (T)
- Speed (v = fλ)

## Examples
Sound waves, water waves, electromagnetic waves.
