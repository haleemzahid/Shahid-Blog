# Newton's Laws of Motion

Today's class covered the three fundamental laws of motion formulated by Sir Isaac Newton.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)
- An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force
- Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion

### 2. Newton's Second Law
- **F = ma** (Force equals mass times acceleration)
- The acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting upon the object and the object's mass

### 3. Newton's Third Law
- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
- Forces always occur in pairs

## Examples Discussed

1. **Car Braking**: When you brake, your body continues forward due to inertia
2. **Rocket Propulsion**: Gases pushed backward cause the rocket to move forward
3. **Walking**: You push backward on the ground, and the ground pushes you forward

## Homework
- Solve problems 1-10 from Chapter 4
- Prepare for next class on Forces and Friction
