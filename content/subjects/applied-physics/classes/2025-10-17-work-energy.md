# Work and Energy

Understanding energy transformations and conservation.

## Definitions
- **Work**: W = F·d·cosθ
- **Kinetic Energy**: KE = ½mv²
- **Potential Energy**: PE = mgh

## Work-Energy Theorem
Net work done equals change in kinetic energy.

## Conservation of Energy
Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.
