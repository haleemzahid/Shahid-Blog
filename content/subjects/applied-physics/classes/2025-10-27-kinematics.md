# Kinematics - Motion in One Dimension

Today we explored the mathematics of motion in one dimension.

## Key Concepts

### Basic Definitions
- **Displacement**: Change in position (vector)
- **Velocity**: Rate of change of displacement
- **Acceleration**: Rate of change of velocity

### Kinematic Equations
1. v = v₀ + at
2. x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at²
3. v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀)

## Problem Solving
We solved several problems involving cars, trains, and free-falling objects.

## Assignment
Complete worksheet on motion problems for next class.
