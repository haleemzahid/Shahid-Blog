# Friction and Its Applications

Understanding frictional forces in motion.

## Friction Types
- **Static Friction**: Prevents motion, fs ≤ μsN
- **Kinetic Friction**: Opposes motion, fk = μkN

## Applications
- Braking systems
- Walking
- Machine design

## Lab Exercise
Measuring coefficient of friction for different surfaces.
