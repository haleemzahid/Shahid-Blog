# Momentum and Collisions

Conservation of momentum in collisions.

## Key Concepts
- Momentum: p = mv
- Impulse: J = FΔt = Δp
- Conservation of momentum in isolated systems

## Types of Collisions
1. Elastic: KE conserved
2. Inelastic: KE not conserved
3. Perfectly inelastic: Objects stick together
