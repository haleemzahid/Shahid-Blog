# Introduction to Thermodynamics

Introduction to the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics and heat transfer.

## Topics Covered

### Heat vs Temperature
- **Heat**: Energy transfer between systems due to temperature difference
- **Temperature**: Measure of average kinetic energy of particles

### First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed
- ΔU = Q - W (Change in internal energy = Heat added - Work done)

## Key Equations
- Q = mcΔT (Heat transfer)
- W = PΔV (Work done by gas)

## Next Class
We'll explore the Second Law of Thermodynamics and entropy.
