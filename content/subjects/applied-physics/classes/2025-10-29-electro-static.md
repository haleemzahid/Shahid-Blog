# Electro static

Electrostatics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of electric charges at rest. It encompasses various concepts such as charge, current, and Coulomb's Law, which describes the force between two charged objects.

## Topics Covered

1. **Charge**: Understanding the nature of electric charge, types of charges (positive and negative), and how they interact with each other.
2. **Current**: Exploring the concept of electric current, its measurement, and the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance.
3. **Coulomb's Law**: Learning about Coulomb's Law, which quantifies the electrostatic force between two point charges. The law states that the force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
