# Functions & Their Representations

## What is a Function?

### Definition

A function f from a set S to a set Y is a rule that assigns a unique value y in Y to each value x in S.

- **Domain**: The set of all possible input values (x-values)
- **Codomain**: The set of all possible output values (y-values)

### Notation

`y = f(x)` (read as "y is a function of x")

## The Four Ways to Represent a Function

### 1. Verbal (Words)

Describe the relationship in words

### 2. Numerical (Table)

Show values in a table

### 3. Algebraic (Formula)

Express as a mathematical formula

### 4. Visual (Graph)

Display on a coordinate graph

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Average Temperature

**1️⃣ VERBAL**
"The average temperature of a city varies throughout the year, increasing from winter to summer and decreasing from summer to winter."

**2️⃣ NUMERICAL**

| Month | Temperature (°C) |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Jan   | 5                |
| Feb   | 8                |
| Mar   | 12               |
| Apr   | 16               |
| May   | 22               |
| Jun   | 27               |
| Jul   | 30               |
| Aug   | 28               |
| Sep   | 23               |
| Oct   | 17               |
| Nov   | 11               |
| Dec   | 6                |

**3️⃣ VISUAL**

### Example 2: Distance and Speed

**1️⃣ VERBAL**
A car travels at 60 miles per hour. The distance traveled depends on how many hours it has been driving.

**2️⃣ ALGEBRAIC**

```
d = 60t
```

Where:

- d = distance (miles)
- t = time (hours)
- 60 = speed (mph)

**3️⃣ NUMERICAL**

| Time (hours) | Distance (miles) |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| 0h           | 0                |
| 1h           | 60               |
| 2h           | 120              |
| 3h           | 180              |
| 4h           | 240              |
| 5h           | 300              |

**4️⃣ VISUAL**
Linear graph starting at origin (0,0) with slope of 60

**Key Insight**: The distance is a function of time. We can calculate distance for any time value using the formula d = 60t.

### Example 3: Cell Phone Plans

**VERBAL**
A cell phone plan costs $30/month plus $5 per GB of data used.

**ALGEBRAIC**

```
C = 30 + 5g
```

Where:

- C = total cost ($)
- g = data (GB)

**NUMERICAL**

| Data Usage (GB) | Cost ($) |
| --------------- | -------- |
| 0 GB            | 30       |
| 1 GB            | 35       |
| 2 GB            | 40       |
| 3 GB            | 45       |
| 5 GB            | 55       |

**VISUAL**
Linear graph starting at (0, 30) with slope of 5

## Mapping Diagrams

A mapping diagram visually shows how elements from the domain map to the codomain using arrows.

### Structure

```
Domain → Codomain
x₁ → f(x₁) = y₁
x₂ → f(x₂) = y₂
x₃ → f(x₃) = y₃
```

### ✓ The Rule of Functions

**Each input must have exactly ONE output arrow**

### Example: f(x) = 2x

- 1 → 2
- 2 → 4
- 3 → 6

✓ **This IS a function** because each input has exactly one output

## Key Takeaways

1. **A function assigns exactly one output to each input**
2. **Functions can be represented four ways:**
   - Verbally (in words)
   - Numerically (in tables)
   - Algebraically (as formulas)
   - Visually (as graphs)
3. **The domain is the set of inputs; the codomain is the set of outputs**
4. **Notation:** y = f(x) means "y is a function of x"
5. **Different representations are useful in different situations**

## Practice Tip

Practice converting between all four representations to strengthen your understanding!

## Additional Notes

- A function must pass the "vertical line test" on a graph - any vertical line should intersect the graph at most once
- In mapping diagrams, each element in the domain must have exactly one arrow pointing out
- Real-world applications help understand abstract function concepts
