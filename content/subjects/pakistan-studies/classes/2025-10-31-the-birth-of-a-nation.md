# Pakistan Studies Class - October 31, 2025

## Topics Covered

### The Birth of a Nation: The Story of Pakistan's Creation and the Two-Nation Theory

#### Prologue: A Land of Harmony

- For over 400 years (1500s-1857), during the Mughal era, Hindus and Muslims lived peacefully side by side
- Communities shared languages (Persian and Urdu), celebrated together, and built a shared culture
- No question of separate nations based on religion arose during this period

#### Chapter 1: The Arrival of the Company

- **1600**: Mughal Emperor Jahangir granted trading rights to English merchants
- **1605-1665**: Establishment of the British East India Company
- British implemented **"Divide and Rule"** strategy
  - A slow-acting poison administered over decades
  - United people are unconquerable, but divided people are easily ruled
  - British pitted communities against each other while appearing as humble merchants

#### Chapter 2: The Battle for Bengal

- **1757**: Battle of Plassey - British victory over the Nawab of Bengal
- **1757-1857**: Systematic British conquest of the subcontinent
- Local rulers reduced to puppets
- British ensured Hindus blamed Muslims and Muslims blamed Hindus, while the real oppressor remained invisible

#### Chapter 3: The Weapon of Language

- For centuries, Persian and Urdu were everyone's languages - bridges, not barriers
- **1867**: Hindi-Urdu Controversy
  - British promoted Hindi as distinctly Hindu and Urdu as distinctly Muslim
  - Different scripts, vocabularies, and literary traditions weaponized as markers of religious identity
  - Riots broke out in Banaras over language
  - Regional variations of the same linguistic family weaponized against each other

#### Chapter 4: The Awakening of Sir Syed

- Sir Syed Ahmed Khan witnessed the violence in Banaras
- Wrote to British Governor Shakespeare concluding: "Hindus and Muslims cannot live together as one nation"
- Birth of the **Two-Nation Theory** in modern political form
- Theory: Hindus and Muslims were not just different religious communities but two separate nations with distinct cultures, languages, and philosophies

#### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Independence

- **1905**: Bengal Partition (annulled in 1911)
  - Reinforced belief in separate identities
  - Planted idea of geographical separation by religion
- **1930**: Allama Muhammad Iqbal's Vision
  - Proposed creation of independent Muslim states in northwestern regions
  - Never uttered the word "Pakistan" in his address
  - Vision was of autonomous Muslim-majority provinces
- **1933**: Chaudhry Rahmat Ali Coins "Pakistan"
  - Writing from Cambridge University in pamphlet "Now or Never"
  - P = Punjab, A = Afghania, K = Kashmir, S = Sindh, TAN = Baluchistan
  - Also means "Land of the Pure" in Urdu

#### Chapter 6: The Lahore Resolution

- **March 23, 1940**: Historic gathering at Minto Park, Lahore
- Formal demand for creation of independent Muslim states in Muslim-majority areas
- Resolution passed with thunderous approval from massive, peaceful crowd
- **Important**: The word "Pakistan" was NOT mentioned in the resolution itself
- **March 24-25, 1940**: Newspapers seized upon Rahmat Ali's name, headlines announced Muslims demanding "Pakistan"
- Media shaped history - what was formally called "independent Muslim states" became forever linked to "Pakistan"

#### Chapter 7: The Struggle Continues

- World War II brought new complexities
- British, weakened by war, could no longer maintain grip on subcontinent
- Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah pushed for Pakistan
- Indian National Congress advocated for united India

#### Chapter 8: Freedom and Farewell

- **August 14, 1947**: Pakistan emerged as independent nation
- One of the largest migrations in human history
- Joy of independence tinged with sorrow and communal violence
- **March 23, 1956**: Pakistan adopted its first constitution (16 years after Lahore Resolution)

## Key Points

### Timeline of Major Events

- **1500s-1857**: Mughal era - 400+ years of peaceful coexistence
- **1600**: Trading rights granted to English merchants
- **1605-1665**: British East India Company established
- **1757**: Battle of Plassey
- **1867**: Hindi-Urdu controversy; Sir Syed's realization

### Critical Lessons

1. **Divide and Rule Strategy**: British deliberately created divisions over a century where none existed before
2. **Language as Weapon**: Weaponizing Hindi-Urdu controversy destroyed centuries of linguistic unity
3. **Manufactured Division**: Social harmony existed for 400+ years but was shattered in one century of manipulation
4. **Media's Power**: The name "Pakistan" became famous through newspapers, not official documents
5. **Gradual Poisoning**: Like smoking addiction, communities didn't realize they were being divided until damage was irreversible

### Questions to Consider

- Who benefits when communities are divided against each other?
- How can we recognize when we're being manipulated into suspicion and hostility?
- What role does language play in either uniting or dividing people?
- How do we build bridges in a world that profits from building walls?

### Personal Reflection on Politics

- Politics is about personal opinions on issues affecting our lives
- Choose battles carefully - focus on what's within our power to change:
  - Becoming independent and self-reliant
  - Improving ourselves and our skills
  - Contributing positively to immediate communities
  - Building understanding rather than division
- Sometimes the most political act is to refuse to be divided
