# Shahid Khan's Personal Website & Blog

Welcome to [shahidkhan.dev](https://shahidkhan.dev), my personal website and blog where I share my journey as a .NET AI Developer and Co-Founder of Dawloom. This site showcases my projects, technical writings, and university coursework.

- **Static Site Generation**: Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for speed and flexibility.
- **Search Functionality**: Implemented using [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com).
- **Illustrations**: I create all the illustrations and comics in my articles on my iPad.
- **IndieWeb Integration**: I've implemented [microformats2](https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) markup, making the site compatible with social readers and other IndieWeb sites.
